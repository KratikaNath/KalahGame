  Kalah Game:
  
  Objective: The objective of the game is to collect as many playing pieces as possible
  before one of the players clears their side of all the playing pieces. 
  
  >RULES:
* Start by placing six stones in each small cup.
* Your mancala is the big basin 6 and 13 according to our program.
* Choose which player is going to go first.
* Going counter-clockwise, the beginning player takes all six stones in one cup on their 
  	side and places one stone each in any four adjacent cups.
* Players can put stones in their own Mancala, but not in their opponent's Mancala.
* Take turns picking up stones in any cup and placing them,
* If your last stone falls into your Mancala, take another turn.
* If the last stone you drop is in an empty cup on your side, capture that piece along with 
  	  any pieces in the hole directly opposite.
* When one player's six cups are completely empty, the game ends. The player who still has stones 
  	  left in their cups captures those stones and puts them in their Mancala. 
     Players compare the number of stones in their Mancala. The player with the most stones wins.
